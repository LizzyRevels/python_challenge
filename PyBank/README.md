Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie

"PyBank"

BACKGROUND
In this homework assignment, I used what I have learned over three days of in class instruction (9 hours), and out of class research to complete this challenge using Python.

Before any coding began:
-I had to create a new repository for this project called python-challenge. 
-Clone the new repository to my computer using gitbash terminal.
-Inside my local git repository, I created a directory for PyBank.

Inside of each folder I added:
-A new file called main.py using terminal command, touch. 
-A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files used in the main.py.
-An "analysis" folder that contains the text file that has the results from the analysis.

Push the above changes to GitHub.

PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS
From homework README (Trilogy Education Services Â© 2019. All Rights Reserved.)
In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

-Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
-The total number of months included in the dataset
-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
